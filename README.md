# SnooFlaps

SnooFlaps is a Reddit client that uses React and Redux. It is a learning exercise and a work in progress.

Make sure to rename `assets/js/settings.rename.js` to `assets/js/settings.js` and fill out the [API details](https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/reddit-oauth-helper). Once you have done this, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`. Navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:8080`.

To build the assets for production you can run `npm run build`. The files will be output to `./dist`.
